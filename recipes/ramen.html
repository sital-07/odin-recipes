        <p>This comforting chicken ramen noodle soup is served with homemade honey Sriracha crackers for crunch and extra flavor.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>¾ cup thinly sliced carrot</li>
            <li>¾ cup sliced celery</li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add carrot, celery, and onion. Cook until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and garlic. Cook 1 minute more. Add broth, soy sauce, basil, oregano, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until carrots are just tender about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in cooked chicken and ramen noodles. Simmer, uncovered, until noodles are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in lime juice. Ladle soup into bowls. Sprinkle with lime zest and, if you like, additional basil and oregano leaves, and serve with Honey-Sriracha Crackers.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch baking pan with foil.</li>
            <li>Heat canola oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until butter is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in honey, Sriracha, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the reserved ramen seasoning packet. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in oyster crackers. Toss together until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Transfer crackers to the prepared pan and spread to an even layer.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, stirring once, until light golden and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely (crackers will continue to crisp as they cool). Store crackers in an airtight container at room temperature up to 2 weeks.</li>
        </ol>
