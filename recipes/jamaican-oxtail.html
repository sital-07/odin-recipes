        <p>I made this oxtail recipe after trying and modifying lots of other oxtail recipes. It is truly delicious!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ pounds oxtail</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Recipe</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place oxtail in a shallow dish. Combine soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, sugar, garlic and herb seasoning, browning sauce, paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Rub both sides of oxtail with soy sauce mixture; discard any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Sear oxtail in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side; transfer to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Sauté carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in the same skillet until softened, about 5 minutes. Add beef broth, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Add oxtail, with its juices, and butter. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until oxtail is fork tender, about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Uncover skillet and increase heat to high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce reduces and thickens, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
